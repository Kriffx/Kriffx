## Hi there üëã

Hi, my name is Cleverson, I'm 29 years old and I live in Porto Alegre, RS - Brazil and even though I don't like football I support Gr√™mio, I really like programming, reading manga/hua/hwa, watching anime and series on my free time.

I work as a Senior QA Automation Engineer for [DBServices](https://dbservices.pt) from home working on a project for Instituto de Inform√°tica de Portugal.

I have knowledge with web and mobile development using Laravel and Nuxt.js, also with automated web and mobile testing using Python with RobotFramework, Cypress, Playwright, Nightwatch.js, Javascript/Typescript/Java with Selenium and several other languages, tools and frameworks.

A curious thing about me is that I have a hearing impairment, but I still hear and speak well, only at certain moments they are difficult, but nothing stops me from carrying out my work and daily life well.

If you are a recruiter, see my CV at [**sampaio.dev.br**](sampaio.dev.br) or want freelance work, get in touch via my email [**cleverson@sampaio.dev.br**](mailto:cleverson@sampaio.dev.br) and finally my [**LinkedIn**](https://www.linkedin.com/in/clesampaio) profile. üòÅ
